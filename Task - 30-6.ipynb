      "Investing in financial markets has traditionally been complex and requires \n",
      "extensive knowledge of economic trends, market dynamics, and risk assessment. \n",
      "Many individual investors lack the expertise and time to analyze stock \n",
      "performance, assess risks, and o ptimize their investment portfolios. Furthermore, \n",
      "conventional investment advisory services are often expensive and not accessible \n",
      "to all individuals, leading to a lack of personalized financial guidance.  \n",
      "With the rise of AI and machine learning, there is an opportunity to develop a \n",
      "personalized AI -powered investment advisor  that can cater to the specific needs \n",

      "solution that provides real-time, customized investment recommendations  \n",
      "based on user profiles, risk tolerance, and market trends.  \n",
      "Key challenges that this project aims to address include:  \n",
      "• Lack of Personalized Guidance : Most investors do not have access to \n",
      "financial advisors who can tailor recommendations to their needs.  \n",
      "• Data Overload and Complexity : The sheer volume of market data, financial \n",

      " \n",
      "1. Atomicit y: The entire transactions takes place at once or doesn’t happen at \n",
      "all. The transactions cannot perform partially. For other users, the transaction \n",
      "is only visible when it is completely executed.  \n",

      "then Transaction failed, and B was never credited.  \n",
      " \n",
      "2. Consistency: The database must be consistent before & after the \n",
      "transactions.  This property is satisfied when each data transaction moves the \n",
      "database from a consistent state to a consistent state.  \n",
      "Using the same example as above, say before Transaction, A’s Balance was \n",
      "Rs. 1000 and B’s Balance was Rs. 2000.  \n",
      "After Transaction (of Rs. 500 from A → B), we expect A’s balance=500Rs \n",

      "A → B and A → C transfer of Rs. 500 in each transaction.  \n",
      "There can be multiple  scenarios where concurrency might cause problems \n",
